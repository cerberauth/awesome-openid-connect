# Awesome OpenID Connect [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> OpenID Connect is an authentication protocol and identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 used in many SSO and adopted in many social logins (Apple, Facebook, Google, etc). Basically, it allows a user to authenticate to a service using an existing account from an OpenID Connect Provider (OP), sharing some identity information after the user consent, and get an access token to access resources on a Relying Party (RP) application.

> Find this curated list of providers, services, libraries, and resources to adopt it and know more about existing and draft specs.
